# Apple Picker
Simple game where apples fall from a tree, and the player must catch these apples in a basket. The basket follows the playerâ€™s mouse and if the player does not catch the apple then they lose one of their three lives.

# Mission Demolition
This is a game similar to Angry Birds where the player must sling projectiles at a structure. The goal is to get the projectile to touch the green goal tile that is defended by the building structure.

# Prototype 1- Flappy Ball
My intentions when making this game were straightforward. I wanted to combine bits and pieces of what I learned from previous projects and mix it all into one game. I thought the best way of doing that was with this platformer. The game idea is simple. The player collects all the moving cubes while avoiding falling objects with their 5 lives. Once all the coins are collected, then a goal appears that the player needs to touch to win. Here are some of the mechanics that I implemented:
- UI Text (Prior projects)
- Lives system (ApplePicker)
- Loading scenes (Mission Demolition)
- Player movement (Roll-a-Ball)
- Rotation Script (Roll-a-Ball)
- Triggers and collision (Prior projects)
- Camera perspective (Mission Demolition)
- Pick Ups (Roll-a-Ball)
- Goal implementation (Mission Demolition)
- Falling objects (ApplePicker)

With these components, I set to achieve a somewhat challenging experience for players. After overcoming the frustration, I wanted the players to feel a sense of accomplishment after getting a feel for the game. What I did not expect to occur was that the player could continuously jump. However, I decided to go along with this mechanic and allowed it to be part of the game experience. By allowing the player to move up, down, left, and right it gives the game a floaty feel which I thought was a bit more unique and engaging. While the game itself is simple, I think it is a good enough challenge that anyone can have some fun playing it. Thank you for checking out my prototype.
